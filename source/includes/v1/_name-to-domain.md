# Name To Domain

The Company Name to Domain API lets you convert the exact name of a company to a website domain, and a logo.

We match based on exact company name, and return the company with the most website traffic. Itâ€™s worth noting, that since a company name is not a unique identifier, you should be prepared for some inherent inaccuracy in the results.
